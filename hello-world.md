This is my first blog. I really don't know where I'm going with this, maybe one day I will be sure which direction I want to take it to. So until then, I will share my experience with web development.  I'm a JavaScript enthusiast; so a lot of what I'll write will be about the most popular programming language. :P

I may occasionally touch upon CSS, HTML, some awesome frameworks, best practices and random insights about programming. I hope you enjoy reading and learning.

I need your comments and feedback to help make this a great blogging experience. Please leave your comments below or contact me directly by mail at <a title="adityasharat" href="mailto:adityasharat@gmail.com" target="_blank">adityasharat@gmail.com</a>
