### On JavaScript

> JavaScript training sucks !!

As a web developer, JavaScript will be your primary programming language. There are tons of resources on the web to learn it, primarily focusing on how it is used in a webpage; but is that all ? I have even felt that most developers don’t consider JavaScript as a serious programming language. That may have been true a few years back when JavaScript was primarily used to make web pages dynamic or interactive. It was used for communicating with the server, updating the UI, maybe animating some stuff on the page. It is still used for doing all that, but much much more.

Still don't think so? Maybe this list will change your mind!

I'm sure you would have heard about most of them and there are many many more. This is all JavaScript and now you can even use JS to build server side applications, desktop extensions, native mobile applications, and program robots.

JavaScript may feel like a very primitive language - it is over 19 years old. It is now that it is popping up in the most unexpected of places. It is one thing to learn it and a completely different challenge to use it in all these scenarios.

>It's the best time to be a JavaScript developer

In order to do that I think we should learn JS just like any other programming language. Here I will share how I learned JavaScript.

Keep an eye out right here... :)
